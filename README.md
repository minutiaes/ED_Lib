## ED_Lib

## This Fork

It aims to benefit from great detection capability of ED_Lib in python environments.
Instead of generating bindings with wrappers, it utilizes `named_pipes` for IPC. A
server, which has detector, answers the detection requests sent from python side.

# How to Use

1. Copy necessary OpenCV DLLs next to `pipe_server.exe`
2. Run `pipe_server.exe`
3. Use `EDLibDetector` class from `./python_scripts/edlib_detector.py`

## Simple Example

```python
PATH_PIPE_SERVER = r"\\path\\to\\server\\pipe_server.exe"
PATH_IMAGE = r"\\billiard.jpg"
pipe_server = Popen([PATH_PIPE_SERVER])
img = cv2.imread(PATH_IMAGE)

detector = EDLibDetector((60, 90))
result = detector.detect(img)
print(result)

EDGE DRAWING LIBRARY FOR GEOMETRIC FEATURE EXTRACTION AND VALIDATION

Keywords: edge detection, edge segment detection, color edge detection, line detection, line segment detection, circle detection, ellipse detection.

Edge Drawing (ED) algorithm is an proactive approach on edge detection problem.
In contrast to many other existing edge detection algorithms which follow a subtractive approach (i.e. after applying gradient filters onto an image eliminating pixels w.r.t. several rules, e.g. non-maximal suppression and hysteresis in Canny), ED algorithm works via an additive strategy, i.e. it picks edge pixels one by one, hence the name Edge Drawing.
Then we process those random shaped edge segments to extract higher level edge features, i.e. lines, circles, ellipses, etc.
The popular method of extraction edge pixels from the thresholded gradient magnitudes is non-maximal supressiun that tests every pixel whether it has the maximum gradient response along its gradient direction and eliminates if it does not.
However, this method does not check status of the neighboring pixels, and therefore might result low quality (in terms of edge continuity, smoothness, thinness, localization) edge segments.
Instead of non-maximal supression, ED points a set of edge pixels and join them by maximizing the total gradient response of edge segments.
Therefore it can extract high quality edge segments without need for an additional hysteresis step.

The list of algorithms in this library:

ED: Edge Drawing detection algorithm. Detects edge segments in an input image and provides the result in segment form (a vector of edge segment pixels).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

EDPF: Edge Drawing - Parameter Free: Detects edge segments without need for parameter tuning. It runs naive ED with all parameters at their extreme to detect all possible edge segments, then invalidates false detected segments due to Helmholtz Principle.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

EDLines: Detects line segments in the image and provides the result as a vector list consisting of starting and ending points.
EDLines is alos a parameter-free algorithm which validates all detected lines via Helmholtz Principle.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

EDCircles: Detects circles and ellipses (up to a level of eccentricity) in an input image and returns the result in a list of circle and ellipse parameters. Just like EDPF and EDLines, EDCircles is alos a parameter-free algorithm that applies validation via Helmholtz Principle.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

EDColor: Edge Drawing - Color: Detects edges in segment form on color image using a color gradient computation, hence provides better results than converting the image to grayscale.

Paper: C. Akinlar, C. Topal, ColorED: Color edge and segment detection by Edge Drawing (ED), Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation, vol.44, pp.82-94, April 2017.

Instructions:
You can detect edge segments with ED, EDPF and EDColor; and lines and circles with EDLines and EDCircles, easily.
It is also possible to feed ED instances to EDLines or EDCircles to extract line segments, circles and ellipses without need to run edge segment detection again.
In this way, redundant computation can be avoided.
Results might slightly differ between using directly EDLines and ED + EDX (EDLines, EDCircles, etc.) because of the differences in default gradient operators and parameters in the algorithms.
There are several usage scenarios available in test.cpp. 

Dependencies: OpenCV 3.4
